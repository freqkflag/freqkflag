# 🧟‍♂️ Joey King | Tech Necromancer 🔧 | Creative Alchemist 🎨 | Rave Dad 🌈  

Hey there, fellow human (or bot). I'm Joey — a professional problem-solver, code conjurer, and creative chaos coordinator based in **Austin, TX**.  
By day, I'm a employee at a well know Alphabet Company, untangling gnarly IT messes and mentoring like a caffeinated wizard.  
By night, I'm slinging code, crafting cosplay, and building spaces that empower the LGBTQ+ community, kinksters, and neurospicy legends like myself.
